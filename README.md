<p id="description">Admins on current Ed-tech platforms are responsible for managing applications manually. Also they accepting new registrations from Google Forms or Microsoft form This includes tasks such as tracking and deleting applications at multiple steps (e.g.. verifying applications - sorting and sending Test links - Inviting them for Interview). These tasks can be time-consuming and error-prone especially when there are a large number of applications to manage. I developed a solution that automates the tasks of managing applications. This solution uses a combination of many features to perform the tasks more quickly and accurately. As a result admins can save time also the normal user finds useful in one platform</p>
